A Universal Image Creator and Shifter for `8x8 LED Matrix`

I have tried to make the code reusable for any purpose (any image can be created simply by adjusting two arrays: one for rows and another for column configurations). The image can be shifted left-right-up-down by passing a parameter while calling the function.
Hope it helps. Thank you ‚ù§

The C code can be used in `ATMEGA32` or similar Microcontroller.
